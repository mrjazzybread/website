I am a PhD candidate working in colaboration with [[https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt][NOVA LINCS]] in
Portugal and [[https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris][Inria Paris]] in the [[https://cambium.inria.fr][Cambium]] team. My research is conducted
under the supervision of [[https://mariojppereira.github.io][Mário Pereira]] and [[https://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/][François Pottier]]. My work
largely revolves around deductive verification and the theory of
programming languages, specifically using [[https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel][Gospel]] (Generic OCaml
SPEcification Language). I also like Emacs! Here's my [[file:econfig.org][config]].

I completed the [[https://www.fct.unl.pt/en][NOVA School of Science and Technology]]'s Integrated
Master's program in 2022.

* Research Work

I am currently working on extending Gospel with fine grained ownership
of values and support for exceptions and algebraic
effects. Additionally, I am also working on translating Gospel
specifications to other verification platforms, such as [[https://github.com/charguer/cfml][CFML]]. My
research notes can be found [[file:notes.org][here]].

This is a continuation of the work I did during my master's thesis
where, under the supervision of Mário Pereira, I created a prototype
extension to the [[https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/cameleer][Cameleer]] verification tool (which uses Gospel) with
support for algebraic effects and handlers leveraging
defunctionalization.

This was itself a continuation of work done in my Bachelor's where I
extended the Cameleer tool with support for higher order functions
using defunctionalization.
